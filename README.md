# Toll-Calculator-Application
Developed an advanced Toll Calculator application using React, Next.js, Hooks, Redux, and memoization. The application should not only consume the TollGuru API to calculate toll costs between two waypoints but also provide users with an immersive experience in understanding how toll calculations work.
